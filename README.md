# BLACKHOLEPREDICTOR
In the realm of astrophysics, understanding the lifecycle and behavior of stars is paramount for unraveling the mysteries of the universe. One pivotal aspect lies in comprehending the relationships between various stellar attributes like temperature, luminosity, and mass, and how they dictate a star's evolution. However, despite significant advancements, gaps in knowledge persist, particularly concerning the classification of stars and the prediction of stellar phenomena such as black hole formation. These gaps underscore the significance of the problem at hand, as accurate classification and prediction models not only enhance our understanding of stellar evolution but also contribute to broader cosmological studies.
Motivated by the desire to contribute to this field, this project aims to leverage data analysis techniques to explore correlations among different star attributes and to develop predictive models for classifying stars and identifying potential black hole candidates. To achieve this, we utilize a comprehensive dataset containing information on temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, star type, star color, and spectral class. Leveraging Python's powerful data analysis libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib equips us with the necessary tools to delve into the complexities of stellar data and extract meaningful insights.

How can we leverage data analysis techniques to explore correlations among various stellar attributes and develop predictive models for classifying stars and identifying potential black hole candidates?
